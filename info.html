            <p>My mom's name is Sushma. She is amazing in general and even better at cooking. My dad, Harish is to the left of her. He is a great father and cares for me and my brother very deeply. In the back is my brother, Adith. He is a genious and has great humour. And in the front is me, Samarth.</p>
